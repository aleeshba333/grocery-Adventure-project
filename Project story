In the magical city of Byteville, there’s a Smart Grocery Store that never sleeps. 
Every product has a secret ID hidden in a Hash Table, so the store can find anything instantly!
Product names are arranged in a Binary Search Tree, so shoppers can see items alphabetically, from apples to zucchini. 
Pending orders and suppliers are kept in Linked Lists, making it easy to add new orders or suppliers anytime.
Customers wait their turn in a Queue, while the recently sold items stack up in a Stack for quick tracking. 
Temporary logs and top-selling product lists are stored in Vectors, always ready for analysis. 
Behind the scenes, pointers, recursion, and modular functions keep the store running smoothly and efficiently.
Thanks to these clever data structures, Byteville’s grocery shopping is magical, fast, and fun for everyone!
