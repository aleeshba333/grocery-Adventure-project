# grocery-Adventure-project
This repository contains a group project for our Data Structures course. It includes an adventure-style story set in a grocery store system, where different characters interact with various data structures like linked lists, queues, hashmaps, and binary search trees
This project represents how a smart grocery store manages products, customers, and orders using core data structures:

HashMap → Stores products using unique product IDs for fast search

Binary Search Tree (BST) → Organizes product names alphabetically

Queue → Manages customer orders in a first-come, first-served manner

Linked List → Tracks pending orders and suppliers

Stack → Stores recently sold items (LIFO history)

The system demonstrates how real-world store operations can be optimized using efficient data structures.
